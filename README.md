# Shoes Store Project


## Overview

This project is a Shoes Store website built to practice and showcase my expertise in TailwindCSS. The website is fully responsive across all screen sizes and demonstrates my ability to   utilize Tailwind classes effectively, including custom styles, @apply, and @theme to maintain consistency and reusability.


## Demo

You can see the live demo of the website [here](https://mahlagha2211.github.io/shoesWebsite/).


## Features

- **One-Page Navigation**: Clicking on any navbar item smoothly scrolls to the respective section.

- **Products Section**: Displays a collection of shoes.

- **Dynamic Shoe Details Page**: Clicking on any shoe navigates to a detailed page using the shoe's id in the URL.

- **Fully Responsive Design**: Ensured seamless experience across all devices using TailwindCSS.


## Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structure of the website.

- **JavaScript** – Handles navigation and dynamic page rendering based on the URL.

- **TailwindCSS** – Used extensively for styling, including:

   - Utility classes for fast styling.

   - @apply to reuse styles efficiently.

   - @theme for custom styling.

 
## Dynamic Shoes Page Functionality

Each shoes in the Products section has an id, and when clicked, the page navigates to:

```
shoesWebsite/src/pageOfShoes/pagesOfShoes.html?id=1  # Example for Shoes 1
shoesWebsite/src/pageOfShoes/pagesOfShoes.html?id=2  # Example for Shoes 2

```

## Conclusion

This project was a great exercise in working with TailwindCSS while improving JavaScript skills for handling dynamic pages. It showcases efficient styling with @apply, @theme, and Tailwind utility classes to build a well-structured, responsive website.
