# Shoes Store Project

## Overview

This project is a Shoes Store website built to practice and showcase my expertise in TailwindCSS. The website is fully responsive across all screen sizes and demonstrates my ability to utilize Tailwind classes effectively, including custom styles, @apply, and @theme to maintain consistency and reusability.

##Features

One-Page Navigation: Clicking on any navbar item smoothly scrolls to the respective section.

Products Section: Displays a collection of shoes.

Dynamic Shoe Details Page: Clicking on any shoe navigates to a detailed page using the shoe's id in the URL.

Fully Responsive Design: Ensured seamless experience across all devices using TailwindCSS.

## Technologies Used

HTML – Structure of the website.

JavaScript – Handles navigation and dynamic page rendering based on the URL.

TailwindCSS – Used extensively for styling, including:
